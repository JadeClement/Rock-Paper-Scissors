# Rock-Paper-Scissors
First Project!
This is a basic Rock-Paper-Scissors Game where one user plays against the computer.
The user has to select play in order to make a move. The user should then choose an option either rock, paper of scissors. 
The website will then display the choices of the user and the computer and update the score. The user can then continue the process and choose another option.
